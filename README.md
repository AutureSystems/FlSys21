# Important

As of the open sourcing, we have removed all branches including those with the unfinished sql rewrite and the version known as "Oreo Distro", which was heavily uncompleted and included code by DevCairo, who left our team. 

The code has had a few bits of it removed, for example the help command. 

Also note that this bot is unfinished. It may run if you have all the dependencies installed, but this is unfinished, abandoned and may have unsupported code. We are open sourcing this project to give you the option to look at a bit of our older code. Of course, if you know python, you can try to finish it and get it running in your server although it should be noted that most important parts have not been finished, don't expect to fix some errors, add 12 lines of code and see it work.
